# Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)

## Pavan

CIAM stands for Customer Identity and Access Management. It is a set of processes and technologies that enable an organization to manage the digital identities of its customers and control their access to its applications and services.

CIAM systems provide a secure and centralized way to manage customer identity information, such as login credentials, personal data, and access permissions. They also enable organizations to authenticate and authorize customer access to resources, enforce compliance with security and privacy regulations, and protect against identity fraud and cyber attacks.

Some common features of CIAM systems include identity verification, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), customer self-service portals, and integration with external identity providers (such as social media or enterprise directories).

This stands for Authentication(to identify), Authorization(to give permission), and Access Control (to giving access), which are the three main functions of a CIAM system. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device, usually by requiring the user to provide login credentials (such as a username and password). Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity and permissions. Accounting is the process of keeping track of user actions and resource usage for the purpose of security and compliance.

## <a name="integration"></a> Integration
CIAM systems often need to integrate with other systems and platforms within an organization, such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), or identity providers (such as social media or enterprise directories). This can involve exchanging data, authenticating users, or sharing access permissions.

## <a name="administration"></a> Administration
CIAM systems typically include tools and interfaces for managing and configuring the system, such as creating and modifying user accounts, setting access policies, and monitoring system performance that named Adminstration flow. 
These flows carry out oversight functions critical to the business. It allows them to view the state of the platform and take any action in the performance of their duties.

## <a name="monitoring-logs"></a> Monitoring & Logs
Monitoring & Logs component typically include tools and process of aggregation & observation of log messages 
often through real-time processing and parsing of these files 
for monitoring system performance and activity. 
This can help organizations detect and troubleshoot issues, 
as well as monitor for security threats.
