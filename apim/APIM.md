## <a name="developer-portal"></a> Developer Portal

Provides a developer portal for developers to learn about, test, and use APIs. The developer portal typically includes
documentation, such as API reference guides and tutorials, a sandbox environment for testing API requests, support
resources such as a knowledge base and community forums, SDK

1. Documentation
2. Sandbox environment
3. Support resources
4. SDKs and code samples
5. Developer registration and onboarding
6. API analytics
7. API management and governance
8. Monetization
9. Lifecycle management

## <a name="monetization"></a> Monetization

Monetizes APIs through billing and pricing, which involves setting up billing plans and pricing tiers for API usage,
payment gateway integration, which involves integrating with payment gateways such as Stripe or PayPal to process
payments, and revenue management, which involves generating invoices, reconciling payments, and managing taxes and
currency conversions.

## <a name="gateway"></a> Gateway

A proxy gateway is a type of API gateway that acts as an intermediary between API consumers and API providers. It
receives requests from API consumers and forwards them to the appropriate API provider.

2. Protocol Translation
3. Transformation

5. Load Balancing
6. Caching
7. Logs & Metrics

## <a name="api-store"></a> API Store

API Store is a component of an API management platform that provides a catalog of APIs for developers to browse,
discover, and subscribe to. It is typically implemented as a web portal or a developer portal, and it serves as a
centralized location for developers to find and learn about the APIs that are available to them.

1. Catalog of APIs
2. Search and filtering tools
3. Documentation and tutorials
4. Test tools and consoles
5. Subscription and billing management
6. Support resources

## <a name="security-policies"></a> Security & Policies

Secures APIs by providing authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of API clients, authorization mechanisms to
determine which clients are allowed to access which resources, and SSL/TLS termination to encrypt communication between
clients and the API gateway.
Policies

1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. SSL/TLS termination

## <a name="monitoring-logs"></a> Monitoring & Logs

Monitors and analyzes API usage through request logging, which captures information about each API request and response,
performance metrics, which measure the performance of the API gateway and backend services, and alerting, which sends
notifications when certain thresholds or conditions are met.

1. Registration
2. Aggregation
3. Monitoring

[Monitoring & Logs](/apim/components/monitoring-logs.md)

## <a name="reports-analytics"></a> Reports & Analytics

Once data is collected, it will be organized using tools such as graphs and tables. The process of organizing this data
is called reporting. Analytics, on the other hand, is the process of taking the organized data and analyzing it in order
to gain valuable insights on how businesses can improve their performance.
