## <a name="developer-portal"></a> Developer Portal
Provides a developer portal for developers to learn about, test, and use APIs. The developer portal typically includes documentation, such as API reference guides and tutorials, a sandbox environment for testing API requests, support resources such as a knowledge base and community forums, SDK

API Store

## <a name="security"></a> Security
Secures APIs by providing authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of API clients, authorization mechanisms to determine which clients are allowed to access which resources, and SSL/TLS termination to encrypt communication between clients and the API gateway.

1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. SSL/TLS termination

## <a name="monitoring-logs"></a> Monitoring & Logs
Monitors and analyzes API usage through request logging, which captures information about each API request and response, performance metrics, which measure the performance of the API gateway and backend services, and alerting, which sends notifications when certain thresholds or conditions are met.

1. Registration
2. Aggregation
3. Monitoring

## <a name="reports-analytics"></a> Reports & Analytics
Once data is collected, it will be organized using tools such as graphs and tables. The process of organizing this data is called reporting. Analytics, on the other hand, is the process of taking the organized data and analyzing it in order to gain valuable insights on how businesses can improve their performance.
